# AGENTS.md

## README

- The Project Structure can be found in root README.md
- Use this to help navigate the project more quickly
- If any errors are found in the project structure while working, feel free to make updates to the README
- Add sections to the README with changes if they are large enough to warrent an update

## TODOs

- Check the TODO.md for tasks that AI can help with if told to work on TODO tasks, otherwise work on the given task from the prompt
- If tasks are in the other group it is most likely because it involves using the editor to move, modify, or create Godot scenes or nodes and does not only involve code changes in scripts
- Ask for approval before making any changes that could break without using the editor properly (Applies for local agents like Cline)

## Coding Conventions
- Use `snake_case` for variables, functions, and folder names
- Use `PascalCase` for class names and enums.
- Constants and values of enums should use `UPPER_CASE`.
- Use `Tab` for indentation
- Limit lines to 100 characters for readability.
- Separate logical lines of code with a single blank line.
- Separate functions with two blank lines.
- Use types wherever possible - function arguments, return values, variable declarations
- If none of these rules apply, follow code conventions from surrounding code or similar files

## Pull Request and Version Control Guidelines

- Prefix PRs created with `codex/`
- Keep PR names simple and use `snake_case`
- Write clear PR descriptions and commits summarizing the change
